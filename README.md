## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Utilizing the `<picture>` element, I was able to achieve responsive images within the product card. By specifying different image sources based on screen size with `<source>` elements and fallback content with the `<img>` element, I ensured the correct image display across various devices.
